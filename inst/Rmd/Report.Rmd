#### SPC Variation Icons

Used to summarise the type of variation seen in the most recent data point of a given measure.

| Icons | Variation Type |
|:-----:|:---------------|
![SC_HI_CON icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_HI_CON.png) ![SC_LO_CON icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_LO_CON.png) | The most recent data point exhibits special cause variation (in a concerning direction).  H is high, L is low.
![SC_HI_IMP icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_HI_IMP.png) ![SC_LO_IMP icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_LO_IMP.png) | The most recent data point exhibits special cause variation (in an improving direction).  H is high, L is low.
![SC_HI_NEUTRAL icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_HI_NEUTRAL.png) ![SC_LO_NEUTRAL icon](../img/variation_icons/SC_LO_NEUTRAL.png) | The most recent data point exhibits special cause variation, but neither direction represents concern or improvement (ie. the measure is neutral).  H is high, L is low.
![CC icon](../img/variation_icons/CC.png) | The most recent data point exhibits common cause variation (ie. naturally-occurring variation, that is not statistically significant).

#### SPC Assurance Icons

Used to summarise whether a measure is assured to meet a target.

| Icons | Assurance Type |
|:-----:|:---------------|
![PASS_TARG icon](../img/assurance_icons/PASS_TARG.png) | The process is assured, and is likely to consistently pass the target set.
![RND_TARG icon](../img/assurance_icons/RND_TARG.png) | The process is not assured, and will pass and fail the target based on variation in the process.
![FAIL_TARG icon](../img/assurance_icons/FAIL_TARG.png) | The process is not assured, and is likely to consistently fail to meet the target set.

#### Data Quality Icons

Used to summarise the data quality status of a given measure, across the four domains detailed below:

| Icons    | Domain | Summary | Detail                                             |
|:--------:|:---:|:------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| ![A icon](../img/dq_icons/star_GWWW.png) | S | Sign-off and Validation       | Is there a named accountable person, who can sign off the data as a true reflection of the activity?  Has the data been checked for validity and consistency? Is there exec-level oversight of this process? |
| ![B icon](../img/dq_icons/star_WGWW.png) | T | Timely & Complete             | Is the data available and up to date at the time of the submission or publication? Are all elements of required information present in the designated data source, and no elements need to be changed at a later date? |
| ![C icon](../img/dq_icons/star_WWGW.png) | A | Audit & Accuracy              | Are processes in place for either external or internal audits of the data, and are these regularly scheduled (eg. quarterly, annually)? Are accuracy checks built into the data collection and reporting processes? |
| ![D icon](../img/dq_icons/star_WWWG.png) | R | Robust systems & Data-capture | Are there robust systems which have been documented according to data dictionary standards for data capture such that it is at a sufficiently granular level? |
