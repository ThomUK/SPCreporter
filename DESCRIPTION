Description: Takes a dataset file and a configuration file to produce an HTML
    report with each metric presented as an SPC chart. The initial rendering of
    the report contains the charts folded to enable quick scanning of
    "variation" and "assurance" status. Each metric can be unfolded to reveal
    the SPC chart to support clinical and management planning. 
    The NHSRplotthedots package is used for SPC calculations, and the
    "variation" and "assurance" is in line with the popular standard within the
    UK's National Health Service (NHS).
