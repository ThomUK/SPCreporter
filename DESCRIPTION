Description: Takes a dataset file and a configuration file to produce an html
    report with each metric presented as an SPC chart.  The initial rendering of
    the report contains the charts folded to enable quick scanning of
    "variation" and "assurance" status.  Each metric can be unfolded to reveal
    the SPC chart to support clinical and management planning. 
    The NHSRplothtedots package is used for SPC calcuations, and the "variation"
    and "assurance" is in line with the popular standard withing the UK's
    National Health Service (NHS).
